### About me
Hi! I’m a data tinkerer who loves the whole pipeline: scrape it, shape it, ship it, and explain it. I’ve worked in analytics and engineering within higher education and healthcare, now working in population health and doing a Master of Public Health in Epidemiology. Open to input on my work & collaborations that turn data into healthier decisions.

### Research
ENGAGE THESIS MODE. I’m researching hospital-acquired pneumonia and building an intervention to reduce its incidence. Give me anything on infectious diseases or rare diseases/conditions and I happily fall right down the research rabbit hole. Check out my presentation from the 2025 Wolfram Tech Conference on a part of my thesis project: [Natural Language Processing for Chest X-ray Findings](https://github.com/KGrafton86/NLP-chest-xray).

### DOGS!
I love making practical things to solve problems, regardless of if they involve data. Check out my [Labrador Coat Colors Tool Prototype](https://github.com/KGrafton86/LabradorCoatColors) for an example. My currently-on-hold pet project (*pun intended*🐾) right now is turning this into a web application.
